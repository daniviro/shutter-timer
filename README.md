Shutter Timer is a simple web application designed to assist photographers working with old SLR cameras in becoming accustomed to longer shutter speeds beyond 1/30.

The concept behind this application is to provide users with a way to practice and develop muscle memory for longer shutter speeds, common in older cameras that do not support shorter exposure times.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface:** The application offers a simple and user-friendly interface.
- **Shutter Speed Practice:** Users can practice adjusting and experimenting with shutter speeds longer than 1/30.

## How to Use

1. Open the web page in your browser.
2. Adjust the shutter timer using the provided controls.
3. Experiment with different shutter speed settings to become accustomed to longer exposures.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [Photography Mapped](https://photography-mapped.com/), an invaluable resource for photographers looking to enhance their skills and better understand photography concepts.
